Customer Churn Prediction – Data-Driven Retention Strategy
Project Overview
Customer retention is one of the most important aspects of running a subscription-based business. Losing customers not only affects revenue but also increases acquisition costs to replace them. This project aims to use machine learning models to predict which customers are likely to churn, helping businesses take preventive actions before it happens.

Objectives:
✔ Predict customer churn using machine learning
✔ Identify key reasons why customers leave
✔ Suggest actionable strategies for improving retention

Understanding the Problem
Churn happens when customers stop using a service. Businesses need to understand:

✔ Who is at risk of leaving?
✔ Why do they leave?
✔ How can we retain them?

By analyzing customer behavior, contract details, and monthly charges, we can build a data-driven approach to reduce churn.

Dataset & Key Findings
The dataset includes information about customer demographics, subscription plans, service usage, and billing details.

Key Findings & Business Impact:
Data-Driven Insights & Business Strategies
Customers with high monthly charges (€90+)

Churn rate: 54%
Solution: Offer loyalty discounts and personalized pricing
Month-to-month contracts lead to high churn

Churn rate: 45%
Solution: Encourage long-term contracts by offering discounts
New customers (tenure < 6 months) are more likely to leave

Churn rate: 56%
Solution: Improve onboarding programs to increase early engagement
Customers with no online services are at higher churn risk

Churn rate: 38%
Solution: Promote service bundles like streaming and cloud storage
Senior citizens (65+) churn more often

Churn rate: 42%
Solution: Provide dedicated customer support and simplified billing

Machine Learning Models & Performance:
We tested multiple models to determine which one best predicts churn:

Model Performance Comparison:
Logistic Regression Model:
Accuracy: 81%
Precision: 0.80
Recall: 0.81
F1-Score: 0.80
Random Forest Model

Accuracy: 79%
Precision: 0.79
Recall: 0.78
F1-Score: 0.79
 Final Decision: Logistic Regression was chosen because of its higher interpretability, making it easier to extract meaningful business insights.

Why Logistic Regression?
It has high accuracy (81%)
It is more interpretable, making it easier to explain to business leaders
It helps understand which features influence churn the most
Business Impact – Translating ML Insights into Actions
The goal is not just to predict churn, but also to reduce it through business decisions.

Business Impact – Translating ML Insights into Actions:
The goal is not just to predict churn, but also to reduce it through business decisions.

Model Insights	Business Recommendations:
High monthly charges lead to high churn	Introduce tiered pricing and loyalty rewards
Month-to-month contracts result in higher churn	Offer annual subscriptions with incentives
Customers who don’t use online services are more likely to leave	Promote add-ons like streaming or cloud storage
Senior citizens need better support	Provide dedicated customer service for this segment

Conclusion:
This project highlights how machine learning can help businesses retain customers by identifying high-risk segments and developing targeted retention strategies. Instead of just predicting churn, we translated data insights into actionable business recommendations.

✔ Companies can reduce churn by improving contracts, offering discounts, and engaging customers early.
✔ Machine learning models help identify patterns that are not obvious with traditional analysis.
✔ This approach provides real-world business value, making it ideal for decision-makers.
